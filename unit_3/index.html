<p>Black Dog Bakery started as an idea in a gym. Two friends residing in Chicago, Illinois, who both enjoyed lifting heavy weights, discovered they both had a second hobby in common. A love for baking full-fat, decadent desserts. Their initial collaborations started as filling orders for small events of friends and supplying baked treats for lifting events.</p>
